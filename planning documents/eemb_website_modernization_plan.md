# EEMB UCSB Website Modernization Plan
## Comprehensive Strategy for a Modern, Engaging Department Website

**Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Department:** Ecology, Evolution & Marine Biology, UC Santa Barbara  
**Project Lead:** Chair's Website Committee

---

## Executive Summary

The EEMB department requires a complete website redesign to accurately reflect its world-class research, diverse community, and forward-thinking vision. The current site (eemb.ucsb.edu) is dated, difficult to navigate, and fails to showcase the department's exceptional achievements in coral reef ecology, marine biology, and evolutionary research.

**Primary Goals:**
1. Create a modern, visually compelling website that attracts top prospective graduate students and faculty
2. Effectively communicate research excellence to donors and community stakeholders
3. Improve content discoverability and user experience across all audiences
4. Implement sustainable content management systems for long-term maintenance
5. Integrate new features: updated DEI section, In Memoriam page, and Good News digest

**Target Audiences (Priority Order):**
- Prospective graduate students
- Prospective faculty candidates
- Donors and funding partners
- Community members and public outreach
- Current students, staff, and faculty

---

## Current Site Audit: Key Findings

### Strengths to Preserve
- Strong research identity in ecology, evolution, and marine biology
- Rich faculty expertise and lab diversity
- Unique location assets (oceanfront campus, field sites)
- Established graduate program reputation
- Separate specialized microsites (diversity.eemb.ucsb.edu, gsac.eemb.ucsb.edu, etc.)

### Critical Weaknesses
1. **Dated Visual Design**: Layout feels 2010s-era with insufficient whitespace and poor typography
2. **Poor Information Hierarchy**: Key achievements and research excellence buried in text
3. **Weak Visual Storytelling**: Limited use of compelling fieldwork imagery, coral reef photos, or research visuals
4. **Fragmented Navigation**: Unclear pathways for different user types
5. **No News/Achievements Section**: Department successes not prominently featured
6. **Outdated DEI Content**: Still references old Working Group System
7. **No Memorial Section**: Recently deceased faculty presence simply removed
8. **Limited Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design but not mobile-first
9. **Inconsistent Lab Website Integration**: Individual lab sites poorly linked/showcased
10. **Content Silos**: Graduate vs undergraduate content poorly differentiated

### Content Inventory Needs
- Complete scrape of all existing pages, links, and content
- Photo and media asset audit
- External link database (to other UCSB sites, research facilities)
- Personnel directory with complete metadata
- Course catalog integration points
- Research area taxonomy development

---

## Design Vision & Principles

### Visual Identity
**Core Concept:** "Ocean of Discovery" - Clean, modern design inspired by coastal California and cutting-edge marine research

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: UCSB Navy (#003660) and UCSB Gold (#FEBC11) as base
- Accent: Ocean blues (light #4A9EC6, deep #1B5E7E) for differentiation
- Neutral: Clean whites, light grays (#F5F5F5), charcoal text (#333333)
- Highlight: Vibrant coral/orange (#FF6B35) for CTAs and key elements

**Typography:**
- Headings: Modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Montserrat) - clean and confident
- Body: Highly readable sans (e.g., Source Sans Pro, Open Sans)
- Scale: Mobile-first responsive hierarchy (18px body minimum on mobile)
- Line height: 1.6-1.8 for optimal readability

### Design Principles

#### 1. Hero-Driven Storytelling
- Full-width hero banner with rotating high-quality imagery:
  - Coral reef fieldwork in Mo'orea
  - Lab research in action
  - Student-faculty collaboration
  - Coastal California ecosystems
  - Kelp forest diving
- Dynamic tagline: "Advancing ocean science from genes to ecosystems"
- Immediate CTAs: "Apply to Graduate Program" | "Explore Our Research" | "Support EEMB"

#### 2. Audience-Centric Modules
Homepage organized in visual "chunks" for different audiences:

**Module 1: Prospective Graduate Students**
- Image: Lab meeting or fieldwork
- Heading: "Join Our Research Community"
- Brief: Funded PhD programs in world-class labs

## New Features & Enhancements

### 1. Updated DEI Section (Chair Priority #1)

**Current Issue:** Website still references outdated Working Group System from 2020 equity letters.

**Solution:**
- Main EEMB site has prominent link to diversity.eemb.ucsb.edu (maintained as separate microsite)
- Update main site "People" section to include DEI Committee leadership
- Homepage module highlighting DEI initiatives
- Coordinate with DEI Committee Co-Chairs (Deron and Cherie) for updated content:
  - New committee structure (5 faculty including 2 co-chairs, 1 staff, 2 grad students, 1 ad hoc)
  - Current initiatives and priorities
  - Success stories and impact
  - Resources and reporting mechanisms

**Content Pages:**
- About > Our Values > Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (overview + link to full site)
- People > Committees > DEI Committee
- Resources > DEI Resources (footer link)

**Update Process:**
1. Meet with Deron and Cherie to review new structure
2. Replace Working Groups language with current Committee framework
3. Update committee composition and member photos
4. Add recent achievements (FUERTE program, recruitment efforts, etc.)
5. Ensure comment box and reporting mechanisms are functional

### 2. In Memoriam Page (Chair Priority #2)

**EXAMPLE 4: Handling Casual/Fun Content**

**EMAIL (Internal):**
> "Good Times: Another Annual EEMB Pumpkin Decorating Contest is in the books! We had six fantastic entries this year, and although voting is closed, you can see the fantastic entries here..."

**WEBSITE OPTIONS:**

**Option 1:** Skip for main website (too casual for external audience)

**Option 2:** Brief mention in quarterly digest only
> "EEMB's annual Halloween traditions brought creative entries from across the department, showcasing the community spirit that defines our collaborative culture."

**Option 3:** Save for social media
> Instagram/Twitter post with photo gallery

**Recommendation:** Internal celebrations (pumpkin contests, coffee hours) stay in emails or social media. Website focuses on research, awards, grants, major community milestones.

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks & Mitigation

**Risk: Content Migration Errors**
- Mitigation: Thorough content audit and testing, maintain backup of old site, staged rollout
- Contingency: Keep old site accessible during transition period

**Risk: Technical Issues Post-Launch**
- Mitigation: Extensive QA testing, soft launch period, monitoring
- Contingency: Rapid response technical support, rollback plan

**Risk: Low Adoption/Engagement**
- Mitigation: User testing pre-launch, training sessions, clear documentation
- Contingency: Iterative improvements based on feedback

**Risk: Outdated Content**
- Mitigation: Clear governance structure, annual content audit schedule, automated reminders
- Contingency: Quarterly review by committee to catch gaps

**Risk: Security Vulnerabilities**
- Mitigation: Regular updates, UCSB IT compliance, security plugins, HTTPS only
- Contingency: Incident response plan, backup restoration procedure

**Risk: Budget Overruns**
- Mitigation: Detailed project scope, phased approach, prioritization of must-have vs nice-to-have
- Contingency: Scale back optional features, extend timeline

**Risk: Accessibility Compliance Issues**
- Mitigation: Design with accessibility from start, regular audits, WCAG 2.1 AA standard
- Contingency: Accessibility remediation as priority fix
