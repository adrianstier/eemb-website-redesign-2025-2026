I received a BA in Human Biology from Stanford University in 2011, and got hooked on research while performing honors research on the water use of trembling aspen trees. I went on to study plant ecology with Janneke Hille Ris Lambers at the University of Washington. I received a PhD in Biology from the UW in 2017, with my dissertation focusing on within-species physiological variation and species geographic range constraints. Before joinging EEMB at UCSB, I spent two years as an NSF Biological Collections postdoctoral fellow and two years as a NOAA Climate and Global Change fellow working jointly with Todd Dawson (UC Berkeley) and Joe Berry (Carnegie Institution for Science) studying plant responses to global change through a lens of drought physiology and remote sensing.",
