Before joining the faculty in the Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology Department at UCSB, Dr. Thellman spent two years working with Dr. Tamlin Pavelsky as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, she worked on creating an ice cover dataset for 100,000s of lakes globally using optical remote sensing. Her current research focus is on how freshwater ecosystems are responding to climate change, especially responses to changing ice and snow conditions.",
