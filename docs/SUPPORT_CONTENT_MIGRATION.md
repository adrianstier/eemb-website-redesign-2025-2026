## 🔄 MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Content Reorganization Plan

**Current Structure Issues:**
1. Flat navigation with no clear hierarchy
2. Some links lead to 404 errors
3. Campus resources buried within support
4. No clear distinction between internal (faculty/staff) and public resources

**Proposed New Structure:**

```
/support
├── /support/administration
│   ├── Staff directory with cards
│   ├── Service areas (accordion or tabs)
│   └── Quick contact section
├── /support/facilities
│   ├── Conference rooms
│   ├── EEMB Shop
│   ├── Greenhouse
│   └── Equipment
├── /support/research
│   ├── Marine Operations
│   ├── Microscopy Facility
│   └── Field Research Support
├── /support/technical
│   ├── IT support
│   ├── Account management
│   └── Network access
├── /support/wellness
│   ├── Emergency contacts (prominent)
│   ├── Counseling services
│   ├── Reporting procedures
│   └── Resource directory
└── /support/students
    ├── Graduate advising
    ├── Undergraduate advising
    ├── DSP accommodations
    └── International student resources
```

### Design Improvements

1. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Emergency contacts in red/prominent boxes
   - Service categories with icons
   - Staff cards with photos and direct contact

2. **Search & Filter**
   - Search bar for finding specific services
   - Filter by audience (faculty, staff, students, public)

3. **Quick Access**
   - "I need help with..." dropdown
   - Popular resources pinned to top
   - Emergency numbers always visible

4. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Tap-to-call phone numbers
   - Collapsible sections
   - Sticky emergency contact bar
